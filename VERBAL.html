          But I did not want to shoot the elephant. I watched him beating his
          bunch of grass against his knees, with the <br />
          preoccupied grandmotherly air that elephants have. It seemed to me
          that it would be murder to shoot him. I had <br />
          never shot an elephant and never wanted to. (Somehow it always seems
          worse to kill large animal.) Besides, there <br />
          was the beast's owner to be considered. But I had got to act quickly.
          I turned to some experienced-looking <br />
          Burmans who had been there when we arrived, and asked them how the
          elephants had been behaving. They all said <br />
          the same thing; he took no notice of you if you left him alone, but he
          might charge if you went too close to <br />
